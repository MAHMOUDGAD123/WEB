00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.500
I've been hearing symphonies

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.800
Before all I heard was silence

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.200
A rhapsody for you and me

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.700
And every melody is timeless

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.500
Life was stringing me along

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.600
Then you came and you cut me loose

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.100
Was solo singing on my own

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.650
Now I can't find the key without you

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.200
And now your song is on repeat

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.400
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.900
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.300
So if you want the truth

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.900
I just wanna be part of your symphony

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.600
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.900
Symphony

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.400
Like a love song on the radio

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.200
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.600
I'm sorry if it's all too much

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.800
Every day you're here, I'm healing

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.400
And I was runnin' out of luck

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.600
I never thought I'd find this feeling

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.600
'Cause I've been hearing symphonies

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.700
Before all I heard was silence

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.550
A rhapsody for you and me

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.100
(A rhapsody for you and me)

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.900
And every melody is timeless

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.800
And now your song is on repeat

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.700
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.100
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.100
So if you want the truth

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.700
I just wanna be part of your symphony

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.900
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.000
Symphony

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.800
Like a love song on the radio

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.500
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.300
And now your song is on repeat

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.300
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.800
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.500
So if you want the truth

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.300
I just wanna be part of your symphony

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.700
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.800
Symphony

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.900
Like a love song on the radio

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.000
Symphony

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.700
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.600
Symphony

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.100
Like a love song on the radio

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.100
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
